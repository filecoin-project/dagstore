// deals expire, removable media is attached/detached, or the IPFS user purges
// content.

// filesystem, detachable mounts, NFS mounts, distributed filesystems like
// Ceph/GlusterFS, HTTP, FTP, etc.

//
//  a. deserialise the Mount from DAG persistence when resuming the system by
//     using a pre-defined Mount factory mapped to the URL scheme.
//  b. support adding mounts from configuration files.
