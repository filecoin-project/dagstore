// which are not using the public interface of the `GarbageCollectionStrategy`.
//
// Note: The `GarbageCollectionStrategy` is only responsible for deciding the order in which reclaimable transients
// should be GC'd. The actual Garbage Collection is done by the dagstore which "owns" the transients.
//
// Implementations of `GarbageCollectionStrategy` are not meant to be thread safe and the dagstore should only
// invoke the `GarbageCollectionStrategy` methods from the event loop.
